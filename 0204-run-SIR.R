#' given that the recovered population is assumed to not get infected again in this model. 
#' And with the SIS model, there is an equilibrium when there are 25% of susceptible farms left.   
#' 
#' 
#' In the SIS model, we can see that the infected population is greater than the susceptible, meaning that under these conditions, there would be an outbreak with this type of model.
#' But the SIR model, by considering that the recovered population won't get infected again,
#' the susceptible population is close to zero after the initial infections seen between week 5 and 10. 
#' Meaning that under this type of model, there won't be an outbreak with these conditions.

#' 
#' As previously mentioned before, the plot with an R0 of 4, was able to cause infection but when the population started to recover, the disease died out given that there weren't susceptibles left. 
#' 
#' When R0 is lower than 1, we see a similar scenario as with and SIS lower than 1 (as shown in practical 2.1).
#' Because the transmission rate is lower than the recovery rate, the disease dies out and is not able to cause an outbreak.
#' So we see that the susceptible population stays close to 100 and the infected population close to zero. 
#' The recovered population is also close to zero given that most farms didn't get infected, so there wasn't a disease to recover from.
