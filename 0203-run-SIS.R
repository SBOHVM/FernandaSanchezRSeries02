#' We are going to compare Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) models for E. coli O157 in cattle, to see if the outcome of putting the timestep inside the function is the same as adding timestep later.

#' 1. Susceptible model
### <b>
#'    $$S(t + 1) = S(t)-\beta \times \frac{S(t)\times I(t)}{N}+\sigma \times I(t)$$
### </b>
#' 2. Infected model
### <b>
#'    $$I(t + 1) = S(t)+\beta \times \frac{S(t)\times I(t)}{N}-\sigma \times I(t)$$
### </b>
#' 3. N is a constant for total population
### <b>
#'    $$N = S(t)+ I(t)$$
