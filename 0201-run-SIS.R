#' We are going to compare four Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) models for E. coli O157 in cattle, with different basic reproduction numbers (R0). 
#'
#' 1. Susceptible model
#'
#'    $$S(t + 1) = S(t)-\beta \times \frac{S(t)\times I(t)}{N} +\sigma \times I(t)$$
#'
#' 2. Infected model
#'
#'    $$I(t + 1) = S(t)+\beta \times \frac{S(t)\times I(t)}{N}-\sigma \times I(t)$$
#'
#' 3. N is a constant for total population
#'
#'    $$N = S(t)+ I(t)$$
#'
#'

#'The same procedure will be done for simulation A, B, C and D. 
#'We only change the ecoli.transmission rate and a default recovery rate of (1/3), therefore changing the basic reproductive number (R0). 
#'Timesteps are in weeks and their start and end time are the same for all simulations. 
#'
#'
#' Set up the simulation parameters, which will be the same for all simulations.
