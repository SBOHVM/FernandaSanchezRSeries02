#' We are going to compare four Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) models for E. coli O157 in cattle, with different week timesteps (1, 0.1, 3 and 5). 
#'
#' 1. Susceptible model
### <b>
#'    $$S(t + 1) = S(t)-\beta \times \frac{S(t)\times I(t)}{N} +\sigma \times I(t)$$
### </b>
#' 2. Infected model
### <b>
#'    $$I(t + 1) = S(t)+\beta \times \frac{S(t)\times I(t)}{N}-\sigma \times I(t)$$
### </b>
#' 3. N is a constant for total population
### <b>
#'    $$N = S(t)+ I(t)$$

#'The same procedure will be done for simulations 1, 2, 3 and 4. 
#'We only change the timesteps. We used the currently stated transmission and recovery rates for E. coli O157, 1 and 1/3, respectively.
#'Start and end time are the same for all simulations.

#'These transmission and recovery rates are the currently stated for E. coli O157 in cattle.
